# Image Conversion Service on AWS

This project is a simple web application that allows users to convert images between different formats. It utilizes AWS Lambda for serverless image conversion and Amazon S3 for storing input and output images. The application provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading images and downloading converted images.


## Features

- Convert images between various formats, including JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF.
- User-friendly web interface for uploading images and downloading converted images.
- Seamless integration with AWS Lambda and Amazon S3 for serverless image conversion.

## Configurations of AWS Services

### Amazon S3
Input and Output Buckets:
- Create two S3 buckets: one for storing input images and another for storing converted images.
- Configure permissions to allow uploads to the input bucket and downloads from the output bucket.
- Set up event notifications to trigger the Lambda function for image conversion upon file upload.

### AWS Lambda
Serverless Image Conversion Function:
- Implement a Lambda function for converting images between different formats.
- Configure the function to trigger automatically in response to S3 upload events.
- Set up IAM execution roles with necessary permissions for accessing S3 buckets and CloudWatch logs.

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Permissions and Roles:
- Define IAM roles with granular permissions for Lambda execution, S3 access, and CloudWatch logging.
- Ensure least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions required for each service.

### Amazon Cognito
User Authentication and Authorization:
- Configure a Cognito User Pool to manage user identities and authentication.
- Integrate Cognito with the web application for user access control.

### Amazon CloudWatch
Logging and Monitoring:
- Set up CloudWatch logs to capture logs generated by the Lambda function during image conversion.
- Configure custom metrics and alarms to monitor Lambda function performance and resource utilization.

### Route 53
DNS Configuration:
- Register a domain name and configured Route 53 to route traffic to the web application hosted on S3.
